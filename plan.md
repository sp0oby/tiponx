# TipOnX Business Plan

## Executive Summary
**TipOnX** is a sleek, simple Web3 tipping app that enables users to tip their favorite X (Twitter) creators with cryptocurrencies using direct wallet-to-wallet transfers. Users log in with their X account to access followed accounts, tip instantly via wallet addresses, and view platform activity in a Recent Transactions section. A Tips Sent section in the user's profile displays their total tipping amount. Built with a retro-styled RetroUI frontend, TipOnX offers a nostalgic, intuitive experience without transaction fees or a native token, relying on premium features and sponsorships for revenue. The app targets the growing crypto creator economy, launching in Q3 2025 with a 4-week MVP.
